    "# 00. PyTorch Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning and deep learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can PyTorch be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch allows you to manipulate and process data and write machine learning algorithms using Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who uses PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the world's largest technology companies such as [Meta (Facebook)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/), Tesla and Microsoft as well as artificial intelligence research companies such as [OpenAI use PyTorch](https://openai.com/blog/openai-pytorch/) to power research and bring machine learning to their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pytorch being used across industry and research](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/00-pytorch-being-used-across-research-and-industry.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Andrej Karpathy (head of AI at Tesla) has given several talks ([PyTorch DevCon 2019](https://youtu.be/oBklltKXtDE), [Tesla AI Day 2021](https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=2904)) about how Tesla uses PyTorch to power their self-driving computer vision models.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is also used in other industries such as agriculture to [power computer vision on tractors](https://medium.com/pytorch/ai-for-ag-production-machine-learning-for-agriculture-e8cfdb9849a1).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning researchers love using PyTorch. And as of February 2022, PyTorch is the [most used deep learning framework on Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/trends), a website for tracking machine learning research papers and the code repositories attached with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch also helps take care of many things such as GPU acceleration (making your code run faster) behind the scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you can focus on manipulating data and writing algorithms and PyTorch will make sure it runs fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if companies such as Tesla and Meta (Facebook) use it to build models they deploy to power hundreds of applications, drive thousands of cars and deliver content to billions of people, it's clearly capable on the development front too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover in this module\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is broken down into different sections (notebooks). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each notebook covers important ideas and concepts within PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent notebooks build upon knowledge from the previous one (numbering starts at 00, 01, 02 and goes to whatever it ends up going to).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook deals with the basic building block of machine learning and deep learning, the tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Topic** | **Contents** |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| **Introduction to tensors** | Tensors are the basic building block of all of machine learning and deep learning. |\n",
    "| **Creating tensors** | Tensors can represent almost any kind of data (images, words, tables of numbers). |\n",
    "| **Getting information from tensors** | If you can put information into a tensor, you'll want to get it out too. |\n",
    "| **Manipulating tensors** | Machine learning algorithms (like neural networks) involve manipulating tensors in many different ways such as adding, multiplying, combining. | \n",
    "| **Dealing with tensor shapes** | One of the most common issues in machine learning is dealing with shape mismatches (trying to mix wrong shaped tensors with other tensors). |\n",
    "| **Indexing on tensors** | If you've indexed on a Python list or NumPy array, it's very similar with tensors, except they can have far more dimensions. |\n",
    "| **Mixing PyTorch tensors and NumPy** | PyTorch plays with tensors ([`torch.Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)), NumPy likes arrays ([`np.ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html)) sometimes you'll want to mix and match these. | \n",
    "| **Reproducibility** | Machine learning is very experimental and since it uses a lot of *randomness* to work, sometimes you'll want that *randomness* to not be so random. |\n",
    "| **Running tensors on GPU** | GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) make your code faster, PyTorch makes it easy to run your code on GPUs. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can you get help?\n",

    "All of the materials for this course [live on GitHub](https://github.com/DeepakYadav9892/PyTorch-Learning-/tree/main).\n",

    "Tensors are the fundamental building block of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their job is to represent data in a numerical way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could represent an image as a tensor with shape `[3, 224, 224]` which would mean `[colour_channels, height, width]`, as in the image has `3` colour channels (red, green, blue), a height of `224` pixels and a width of `224` pixels.\n",
